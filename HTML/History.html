            <p>ASICS Ltd. started as Onitsuka Co., Ltd on September 1, 1949. The founder, Kihachiro Onitsuka, started producing basketball shoes at his home in the city of Kobe, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. Onitsuka became particularly well known for its Mexico 66 design, in which distinctive lines run across it, now synonymous with the company's brand. In 1977, Onitsuka Tiger merged with GTO and JELENK to form ASICS Corporation. Despite the name, ASICS footwear products are still produced and sold internationally under the Onitsuka Tiger label.</p>
